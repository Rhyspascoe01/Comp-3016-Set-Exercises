You are in your living quarters, the walls giving you a newfound sense of claustrophobia after a couple of hours of your best to find what you needed to survive with the entity on board. The four metal walls around you are bathed in a red flashing light and the sound of a siren echoed through the halls, the smell of warm air and fear thick in your nostrils. You managed to grab hold a flash light and a chocolate bar that was resting inside of your cupboard. The only direction that you can move now is forward. You can also check your inventory.
You are in the central hallway, the sound of the siren being ever louder as well as the sound of something dripping echoing out across the hall. Your flash light allows you to see two doors ahead of you, one to he left and one to the right. You can also choose to move deeper within the submarine.
You enter into the bottom floor kitchen, the entire room being desecrated by the intruder. Appliances were ripped off the wall and thrown to the floor, glasses were smashed and a locked toolbox. 
You unlock the toolbox to see a pair of metal cutters with you taking the cutters in the process.
You enter into the bottom floor kitchen, the entire room being desecrated by the intruder. Appliances were ripped off the wall and thrown to the floor, glass being smashed and a large dent is gouged out of the wall.
You enter the right-side room to see several fresh scars in the metal wall, a puddle of water laying on the floor as well as a cracked computer screen on top of a series of ransacked containers.
You looked at the computer screen to see the cracked screen was frozen on a news article. The part of the article that you could read stated "Two months ago, seventeen settlements were found on the edge of the pacific ocean with these settlements being debated as the oldest in human history. Three research Vessels, The Hauler St. Piran, The Research Submarine St. Anne and the RTX-738 unmanned submarine have been assigned to the project."
You bent down to look into the containers, seeing nothing of worth in there other then ripped up and waterlogged documents.
You moved further into the hallway, seeing an empty hallway along with the area where you could go down to the lower floor, although you could swear you could hear something crawling in the vents above you, slamming echoing out in the process.
You moved to the lower access port, looking down at the hole to see that there was a metal bar jammed within the valve, impeding your escape. That was when you proceeded to hear the vent cover hit the ground, a pair of feet hitting the ground a moment later in the process.
You attempt to turn around and move back into the hallway, only to be blocked by the intruder, waterlogged hair brushing past your shoulders, her facial features being hidden by the darkness other then her cold, dead eyes. She raised a spear into the air, letting out a shallow grunt before it found it's new home in your chest, a sudden rush of pain moving through your chest before you felt a sudden coldness and everything went black.
You turned around and shone your flash light at the intruder, a hiss moving across the air as the woman went to cover her eyes. She was taller then you and seemed to be soaking wet, her clothes being made up of cotton and the hides of fish, the woman clutching a metal spear in her hand. She would retreat, hissing out and running towards the darkness as she left you alone, the woman seemingly having left a key resting in a puddle.
You use the metal cutters on the metal bar, managing to get the bar cut after several attempts at sawing through the metal. With that you spun the valve and opened the porthole, looking down at the abyss as footsteps started to emerge behind you again.
You would climb down to the lower floor, hearing as the metal ladder creek with your weight as you eventually managed to hit the ground, looking around as you did so. The entire area was rusted, flakes of metal fallen onto the floor and caking every surface, the three hallways leading from the entrance drenched in a flashing orange light.
You would move down into the left corridor, the hard metal walls being replaced with walls of rusted metal pipes with varying valves and levers sticking out of them as you started to feel as the air that surrounded you got hotter and hotter.
You moved deeper and deeper into the corridor, feeling as sweat moved down your skin as the air got hotter and hotter by the moment before you eventually reached the boiler room. The could hear the sounds of the massive metal boilers gasping and groaning out into the air, the boilers shuddering somewhat as you realised you could either go forward or to the left.
You moved further into the boiler room to see a hole, hearing as steam fizzed out as you saw a hole in the corner of the room.
You looked at the hole to see what appeared to be a screwdriver wedged into the pipe, an open steam vent blocking you from grabbing hold of it.
You go left into the boiler room, moving into a small backroom area to see a series of three valves attached to three large pipes. From left to right the Valves read "Compartment relax north", "Emergency release" and "Compartment relax south"
You twist the Compartment relax north valve, the sound of the pipes groaning as the pressure was placed back into the pipe.
You twisted the "Emergency release" valve, the sudden sound of several ports flying open with you looking behind you to see the room behind you filling with boiling hot steam.
You twisted the "Emergency release" valve, the sound of the ports shutting echoing out across the halls of the boiler room.
You twisted the "Compartment relax south" valve, hearing as something would hiss out in an area that you couldn't quite see.
You looked into the hole to see that it was now clear and the screwdriver remain wedged within the metal pipes. You reached inside and grabbed hold of the screwdriver, stuffing it within your pocket as you did so.
You would attempt to move into the entrance only to see her staring back at you, the woman walking down the corridor and scraping her spear down the pipes as she would do so.
You attempted to push past the woman before she would push you into the boiler room before she proceeded to slam her spear through your chest, the spear moving right through your body and jamming into the boiler behind you. Steam covered your back as you stared into her eyes, the dead stare being filled with disgust as your vision faded and went black.
You twisted the "Emergency release" valve, the sudden sound of several ports flying open with you looking behind you to see the room behind you filling with boiling hot steam. You could also see the intruder within the steam, backing away before leaving you alone, the sound of her growling echoing out across the air in the process.
You twisted the "Compartment relax south" valve, hearing as something would hiss out in an area that you couldn't quite see. You then saw as the intruder would dive into the room, raising her spear behind her head and ramming it into your skull, every strain of your consciousness being ripped away from you in an instant.
You moved into the middle corridor, the sheet metal walls still being rusty despite the new coats of paint that were attempting to cover it up.
You moved deeper into the corridor and managed to get into the cargo bay of the submarine, several of the containers being ripped apart as if someone was searching for something, several bits of paper laying on the floor. To the right of you there is the door to the stairwell that leads to the top of the ship.
You moved to the door to see that it wasn't just locked but the box the card reader was located in was locked shut, the key having snapped off in the keyhole which meant you couldn't unlock it although it seems you could unscrew the latches keeping the door on the box by the looks of things.
You crouched down and looked at the paper that was laying on the floor, seeing that it was waterlogged. The paper seemed to be a series of newspaper clippings, the clips reading "Anita Summers, 28, has still not been found although she has been suspected to not be found alive. The woman, a veterinarian, went missing on the 28th of September after allegedly being asked to go on a boat ride with what police assumed to be her boyfriend."
You would move into the right corridor, letting out a series of coughs into the air as the scent of diesel moved through the air, the walls being coated in a mixture of rust and slightly melted fuel.
You continued to move down the hallway, eventually finding yourself in the engine room of the submarine, the sound of the vessels beating heart creaking and screeching out into the air as the scent of diesel choked the air. You could see a path in front of you but you could also see a path to your right.
You move forward to see the control panel for the engine, a couple of the buttons being torn off although the method to turn on the ventilation in the engine was still able to be moved.
You would twist the engine ventilation to high, the fans starting to whirr to life as you felt a very brief chill moving across your skin as the scent of fuel moved from the air.
You attempted to move behind the engine only to be pushed back by a burst of heat with it feeling like you'd melt your skin off if you got closer to it.
You attempted to move behind the engine, being successful and managing to get behind the pulsing machine. You looked down the compartment to see a bunch of oil covered papers and a slightly melted key card resting in the middle.
You pick up the key card, hoping that it would at be functional as you would do so.
You looked down at the oil covered papers, being able to make out a few of the words which read "Alexander [blank],the main suspect behind the Anita Summers case, has been found dead in his own boat in the middle of the pacific ocean. The case has baffled the police, stating that it appears someone had somehow climbed out the water, slashed and stabbed at the man with a sharp object and then swam away. "
You started to unscrew the latches that kept the door of the box connected to the key card scanner, the door falling to the ground with a loud thud as you looked at the key card scanner.
You scanned the key card several times, the light flashing red before eventually flashing a bright green, the sound of the slight crunch that the locking mechanism of the door made echoing out in the air.
You opened the door and entered into the stairwell, moving up the flights of stairs before you entered into the top floor. In contrast to the bottom floor, this one was clean and contained only two corridors to go down, one going to the left and one right down the centre.
You move down the left corridor and turn the corner to find a series of rooms, a few of the doors left opened. Doors 1001, 1003 and 1004 are shut whilst Doors 1002, 1005 and 1006 are open.
You moved into Door 1001, opening the door to see a room for storing food and drink, almost all of it being thrown onto the floor although you could swear you could see something within the pile of clutter.
You would start rummaging through the pile, throwing leaking cans of soda and packets of crisps into the hallway before you saw what was glistening to see it was a key with the number "2" attached to it.
You look inside of room 1002 to see the room was where the emergency weapons were stored, seeing the harpoon gun was still locked with three padlocks and a five digit code at the bottom.
You would go to door 1003 and opened it, seeing that the room consisted of a desk and a few chairs that had been thrown around the place, the papers being soaked through which meant you couldn't make out most of them.
You would start reading the papers, most of them being unreadable except for one on the far left and one on the far right. The note on the far left was a handwritten note reading "SQUARE-TRIANGLE-HEXAGON-PENTAGON-SEMICIRCLE" with "REMEMBER" over the top of it. The paper to the right was a news headline cut out, reading "Mysterious disappearances above uncovered civilisation continue."
You would move into door 1004, trying to get the door open before seeing that it was locked shut.
You would move to door 1005, looking into the room to see several wreaked objects as you would see a key wedged into the shredder as well as a few coat hangers resting on the ground.
You tried to tug the key out, being unable too but you did notice that there was a hole in the key that you could use to hook it with.
You picked up the coat hanger.
You hooked the coat hanger to hook around the key, managing to take it out after a couple of tugs. You could see the key had a 1 written on it.
You looked into room 1006 to see that it seemed to be relatively clean, a key with the number 3 on it resting right on the floor.
You picked up the key on the floor, feeling that this was just a bit too easy until you heard something rustling around in the closet. Suddenly the closet doors would fly open and she would appear out of it with you now noticing that the woman was wearing a necklace with varying keys and bones attached to it, the woman raising her spear to attack you.
You'd run out into the hallway, an annoyed grunt escaping her mouth as she would  raise her spear behind her head, getting ready to throw it as she would do so.
You attempted to run into the opposite room, the woman throwing her spear right into your back as she did so, tearing through your spine and causing you to fall to the ground, the last things that you were able to hear being her footsteps and the spear being torn out of your body.
You would run into room 1002, looking at the harpoon gun container, hearing the sound of her spear ramming into the metal walls of the other room in the process.
You started to unlock the container, pushing each of the keys into the lock and unlocking them and leaving only the code to unlock as you would do so as you heard her walking down the hallway, scraping her spear across the floor as she did so.
You attempted to unlock the box, realising that you  were unable to do so At that moment you felt as as a shadow moved over you before air moved above your head, a brief pain moving through your head as everything went black.
You would turn the passcode lock so that it read 43652, hearing as the container unlocked which was when you grabbed hold of the harpoon gun, ready to kill the intruder as you did so.
You would turn around to see her standing there, the woman attempting to charge you before you pulled the trigger, hearing the sound of the harpoon popping out of the gun as the slither of metal shot through the air and rammed right into the bottom of her head, moving though her jaw and skull in the process. The woman would stumble backwards, hitting against the wall and scraping down it, seemingly being dead as you were left with an empty harpoon gun.
You looked over the woman, seeing that she seemed to have the keys to the exit wrapped around her neck.
You grabbed hold of the key, pulling on the waterlogged rope and tearing it in half as you pocketed the exit key.
You went down the centre corridor, running through it before you managed to get to the front deck, looking around the relatively clean room as you glanced over to the door towards the exit porthole.
You went to open the door, testing it a couple of times to see that it was locked. It seems that someone may have taken the key.
You pushed the key into the door, hearing it clip open as you swore you could hear footsteps starting to get louder as they walked down the hallway. You opened the door, looking at the ladder leading to the outside of the submarine.
The footsteps grew louder and louder as you climbed up the ladder to the porthole, grabbing hold of it and popping it open. You climbed out the submarine and looked down to see the intruder underneath you, slamming the porthole shut and slowly tighten the valve as you heard slamming from within the submarine.
You pick up the key, feeling as drops of water would fall off it. Just by the look you can tell the key is not for a door lock.
You moved back into the boiler room. The could hear the sounds of the massive metal boilers gasping and groaning out into the air, the boilers shuddering somewhat as you realised you could either go forward or to the left.
You go back into the corridor that led to a series of rooms, a few of the doors left opened. Doors 1001, 1003 and 1004 are shut whilst Doors 1002, 1005 and 1006 are open.
