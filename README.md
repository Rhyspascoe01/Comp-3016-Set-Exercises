#### Visual Studio and operating system Version
For this project I used was Visual Studio 2022 and my operating system I used is Windows 11 Home version 22H2

#### How Does it play
My game, called St.Anne, is a text adventure game where the player is stuck on a submarine called the St.Anne where they are last member of the crew, being hunted by a mysterous entity. The game is played with text prompts so if you want to go forward then you type "Go_Forward" and you'll move deeper into the St.Anne. Throughout the game you with not only have to interact with the enviroment to solve puzzles and gain items so you can escape the ship but also use the items and enviroment around you to defend yourself against the intruder when her scenarios start to play out.

#### Exception handling and test cases
During the coding my project i have Exception handling to the inputs that the player uses as a Player could type something in that i have not coded a response for so i have coded that the program tries the certain input triggers and if none of those have been triggered then it triggers the catch statement which shows a error message and allows the user to type a different input. I have also done several test cases for my project of which you can read below :
